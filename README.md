# Session-1
The first session ever organized for cool coderin.

In this session, the fundamentals of HTML and CSS are introduced. The aim is to enable the participants to get started with their own personal website. A little bit of theory related to the web is also introduced.

Two files will be provided, index.html and style.css
The goal is to complete them in  order to have a functional website and to deploy the website from the participant's GitHub account.
